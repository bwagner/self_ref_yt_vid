# Running QR Codes for YouTube Audio

Generate a video of **continuously updating QR codes** that point to the *current timestamp* of your audio on YouTube.  
Viewers can pause at any moment, scan the on-screen QR, and jump straight to that exact time.

> **Use case:** Long podcasts, lectures, or interviews uploaded to YouTube.  
> This script makes it easy to bookmark and share precise moments with a phone camera‚Äîno scrubbing required.

## ‚ú® Features

- Creates a video with QR codes that update every *N* seconds.
- QR codes point to `SHORTENER_URL?t=SECONDS`.
- Muxes video + audio into an H.264 MP4 with AAC audio.
- Optionally generates an `.srt` subtitle file with URLs per timestamp.
- Designed for use with URL shorteners like TinyURL.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**
- **ffmpeg + ffprobe** installed and in `PATH`
- Python dependencies:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `qrcode[pil]`
  - `rich`
  - `typer`

> If you use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), the shebang at the top of the script handles dependencies automatically.

## üîó Workflow with TinyURL

1. Pick a unique short URL stem (don‚Äôt create it yet), e.g.  
   `https://tinyurl.com/myshow2025`
2. Run the script with your audio file and the chosen stem.
3. Upload the generated video (and optional `.srt`) to YouTube.
4. Create the TinyURL and point it to your YouTube video URL.
5. Scanning QR codes in the video now jumps to the correct timestamp.

## üöÄ Usage

### Using `uv` (recommended)

```bash
chmod +x run_qr_codes.py
./run_qr_codes.py audio.mp3 https://tinyurl.com/myshow2025 -o qr_codes_video.mp4 -d 1
```

### Using Python directly

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install opencv-python numpy "qrcode[pil]" rich typer

python run_qr_codes.py audio.mp3 https://tinyurl.com/myshow2025 \
  --output qr_codes_video.mp4 --duration 1
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Outputs

- `qr_codes_video.mp4` ‚Äì video with QR codes + audio  
- `qr_codes_video.srt` ‚Äì matching subtitles with QR URLs

Example `.srt`:

```
1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
https://tinyurl.com/myshow2025?t=0

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips

- Use **incognito mode** when testing, to prevent YouTube‚Äôs resume position from overriding `t=‚Ä¶`.
- For better scan reliability:
  - Increase QR display duration (`-d 2` or `-d 5`).
  - Scale video to higher resolution after rendering:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -i qr_codes_video.mp4 -vf "scale=1920:1080:flags=neighbor" -c:a copy qr_1080p.mp4
    ```
